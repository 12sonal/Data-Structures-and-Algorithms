------ Step 2: Tree Leaves build in this order ------
Leaf node 1 B 1
Leaf node 2 c 1
Leaf node 3 k 1
Leaf node 4 s 1
Leaf node 5 p 1
Leaf node 6 v 1
Leaf node 7 u 1
Leaf node 8 n 1
Leaf node 9 w 1
Leaf node 10 ? 1
Leaf node 11 b 2
Leaf node 12 l 2
Leaf node 13 h 2
Leaf node 14 y 2
Leaf node 15 , 3
Leaf node 16 e 3
Leaf node 17 o 3
Leaf node 18 a 7
Leaf node 19   7

------ Step 3: Internal Nodes of the Tree is build in this order ------
Internal Node 20: Bc 2
Internal Node 21: ks 2
Internal Node 22: pv 2
Internal Node 23: un 2
Internal Node 24: w? 2
Internal Node 25: bl 4
Internal Node 26: hy 4
Internal Node 27: Bcks 4
Internal Node 28: pvun 4
Internal Node 29: w?, 5
Internal Node 30: eo 6
Internal Node 31: blhy 8
Internal Node 32: Bckspvun 8
Internal Node 33: w?,eo 11
Internal Node 34: a  14
Internal Node 35: blhyBckspvun 16
Internal Node 36: w?,eoa  25
Internal Node 37: blhyBckspvunw?,eoa  41
Tree has 37 nodes

------Step 4: Writing Dot file at Location------: D:\Output\7.dot

------ Step 5: Code for each character is as follows -------
B code is 01000
a code is 110
, code is 1001
  code is 111
b code is 0000
l code is 0001
c code is 01001
k code is 01010
s code is 01011
h code is 0010
e code is 1010
p code is 01100
v code is 01101
y code is 0011
o code is 1011
u code is 01110
n code is 01111
w code is 10000
? code is 10001

------Step 6: Encoding-------
Encoded string: 0100011011010011110000110110100111100000001110010010101011101011001010101010011001001111001011001101101011100111011011101111100111100111111000010111011000110001
Decoded string: Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
Original string: Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
Your     string: Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
